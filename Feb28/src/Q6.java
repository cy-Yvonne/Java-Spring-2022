/*
6)	What is wrong with the following code? Fix the issues in the code.

if (score >= 60)
  System.out.println("D");
else if (score >= 70)
  System.out.println("C");
else if (score >= 80)
  System.out.println("B");
else if (score >= 90)
  System.out.println("A");
else 
  System.out.println("F");


My Answer:
Because the first condition is (score >=60) then none of the numbers bigger than 60 would even be reached. What I mean is, if score = 90, then it would satisfy the first condition because it's greater than 60. The program would say that your score is a D which is not correct. This would be a programmer error.
